  "transcript": "You've probably seen Google's\nflashy Gemini trailer,\nthe AI that does it all,\nor does it really?\nIn light of Google Searches AI\nless than stellar performance,\nI think a detailed\nGoogle Gemini review is warranted.\nDid this IT giant create\nthe new AI revolution,\nor are we looking\nat a poorly rendered ChatGPT client?\nLet me answer the most important question.\nIs Google Gemini free?\nThe answer is, yes and no.\nThat's because Google Gemini Advanced\nis a paid subscription service,\nmuch like ChatGPT 4.0.\nThey even have the same price.\nStill, free users\ncan get their questions answered\nby Google Gemini Pro,\na less powerful version of Advanced.\nBy the way, if you are expecting\na Gemini versus ChatGPT comparison,\nyou won't find it here,\nbut I might do a video on that topic\na bit later\nif you drop a like.\nBefore we take a closer look\nat what can Google Gemini do,\njust keep in mind that everything you say\nto it can and will be used against...\nWait, sorry, wrong script.\nIt will be collected\nand used to further train the AI,\nso better avoid having\nany personal details in your questions.\nI decided to thoroughly question Gemini\non various topics,\nranging from\nsummarizing articles and researching\nto daily chores like shopping.\nLet's start with that.\nI actually went ahead\nand let Google Gemini AI know\nthat I was looking for a handheld console.\nMy choice was\nbetween Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck.\nI simply made Gemini compare them for me.\nAt first,\nit didn't give me a lot of detail.\nMostly throwing out general statements\nmade in various articles.\nI needed something more factual,\nmore numerical.\nThen I remembered\nthe AI is only as smart as I am,\nand I am very smart.\nThis time,\nI created into a more detailed prompt.\nGemini, give me a comparison\nof hardware elements\nin numerical values where possible.\nNot only did I get what I asked for,\nbut Gemini actually generated a table\nI could then export into my workspace,\nspecifically Google Sheets,\nand I could do that with any comparison.\nWant to know if the iPhone 16\nis going to catch up to the high-tier\nAndroid phones hardware-wise?\nGet a table for it.\nThis is going to be a long video.\nMust stay hydrated.\nOf course, electronics\nare not the only example you could take.\nI did a few comparisons of car models,\nsome household devices,\nconstruction materials, and so on.\nThat said, I have enough experience\nwith those chatbots to realize\nthat they often hallucinate,\nespecially when it comes to numbers\nor obscure facts.\nThat's why\nI had to double-check the info, or do I?\nGemini can double-check itself\nand give you the sources it used\nto verify the information.\nThis is convenient.\nPlus, I can always export my information\nin the Google Workspace.\nI have a feeling that this integration\nwith other Google services\nis exactly what Gemini needed\nto contrast against ChatGPT.\nGemini can help me deal with shopping,\nbut how do you use Google Gemini\nfor literally anything else?\nI decided to ask about\neasy cooking recipes.\nI remember ChatGPT being way too fancy,\neven when dealing with\nbeginner-friendly recipes.\nUnfortunately,\nwith Google Gemini is no different.\nI asked for a simple Indian dish recipe\nthat would be easy to cook\nand wouldn't require complicated results,\nand that's what I got.\nDon't be surprised by this Google Doc.\nAny Gemini response\ncan be easily exported into Google,\nso that's just what I did for this video.\nThat's because I wanted to enable\nauto purge of my personal details,\nprohibiting Gemini from saving\nmy conversation with it\nfor over 72 hours, allegedly.\nAnyway, back to the recipe.\nI can already tell that I'm in trouble.\nWith steak being my go-to,\nthese spices\nare a bit too advanced for me.\nI'm getting a feeling\nthat Gemini thinks I'm Gordon Ramsay.\nSo I've downloaded that recipe,\ncreated a new chat,\nand uploaded the recipe there,\nthinking Gemini might as well help me\nfind alternatives to these spices.\nAnd it did.\nOf course, this might still be\na bit complicated for a beginner,\nbut the important part is that\nGemini by Google managed to suggest\nwhich pieces are safe to take out\nof the equation\nand what can be just simplified.\nThis is an important quality\nfor an AI chatbot like this one,\nand it might come in handy\nwhen doing research.\nFrom the earlier parts of the video,\nyou might have realized I'm into gaming.\nSo this time I decided\nto ask Google Gemini AI\nabout the main boogie man\nof the gaming industry.\nDo violent games affect kids?\nWe all know that's not the case.\nWhile there can be a minor correlation,\nno causation has been proven so far.\nGemini ended up saying exactly that\nwhile also showing off its knowledge\nof fancy scientific words.\nShow off.\nIn any case,\nthe results it gave me made sense.\nBut where did they come from?\nAsking for links,\nI got plenty in response,\nall of them coming\nfrom scientific research\njust like I requested.\nBut let's be real.\nWhile I, and probably you,\nlook for accurate factual answers,\nnot everybody's going to play nice\nwith artificial intelligence.\nGoogle Gemini could be used to cherry-pick\nunless there are fail-safe to prevent it.\nSo I asked it to only provide sources\nsupporting the claim\nthat video games negatively affect kids,\nand it did,\nbut not without adding a note\nthat this topic\ndoesn't have a conclusive answer.\nBut if I'm yet another boomer looking\nto argue with my kids,\nI don't want that.\nI want to win the argument.\nSo I went all out.\nI asked Gemini to write me a monolog\nusing these articles as fuel\nalongside logical fallacies\nlike straw-manning,\nslippery slopes, red herrings,\nand even some straight-up gaslighting,\nall for the sake of pushing the narrative.\nAnd Gemini did it.\nI honestly expected it to decline.\nThat's what ChatGPT is trained to do.\nBut instead, Google AI gave me\na pretty aggressive monolog\nfull of manipulative techniques.\nI know that this is going south,\nbut I just want to point out\nthat not only can Gemini analyze sources\nand provide an accurate recap of data,\nbut it can also twist the narrative\nif asked to do so.\nI'm not sure we want this tool\nto be available for our politicians\nat the $20 Google Gemini pricing point.\nThat went dark real fast.\nI guess now we need\nsomething more light-eyed.\nI know, I got this.\nLet's make Gemini summarize my article\nabout AI getting added\nto all Chromebook laptops\nin three sentences or less.\nAnd done.\nOkay, looks good.\nNot sure why it missed the part about\nusing QR codes\nto I set up new Chromebooks.\nI thought it was pretty important,\nbut I'll let that slide.\nRemember that Gemini can look up\nother sources through double-checking.\nI can see all claims from my article\ncoming up green and correct\nwith neat links for each statement,\ngiving me extra material\nto check if I need to.\nThis ain't over yet either.\nI want to do something\nI've been putting off for ages.\nI want to take a trip\nto the Big Apple and see Broadway.\nThis will be a complex task for Gemini\nto find the best plane tickets for me\nand choose the dates\nwhere I would have the best opportunity\nto check out the most highly-rated\nBroadway musicals possible.\nSurprisingly, I got almost\nthe perfect answer from the get-go.\nIt listed all the musicals I wanted to see\nand gave me a distinct time period\nbased both on available shows\nand the plane ticket prices.\nI'll further ask it\nto find plane tickets for that period\nand accommodation options.\nThe first part went without a hitch.\nGemini suggested good flight options,\nconsidering the budget I gave it.\nAs for accommodation,\nI expected more.\nGemini couldn't tell that\none of the hotel links it gave me\nwas from Wikipedia,\nthe other was way beyond my budget,\nand the third,\nwasn't even available during those dates.\nSeems like dealing with this information\nis a bit beyond its scope.\nBut can Gemini find\na YouTube video for me?\nLet's say the best ElevenLabs review.\nGemini, do your thing.\nI see.\nGood job, Gemini.\nYou can clearly see\nthe appeal of my content.\nStill, one could say that I rigged it.\nI know you're thinking I rigged it,\nso let's ask Gemini\nwhy it made such a choice.\nFor the record, not rigged.\nHere we have a few reasons,\nbut those are too broad.\nHonestly, this has been a reoccurring\nissue I have with Google Gemini.\nUnless you phrase your question\nin a very, very specific way,\nyou're getting a very broad\nand non-descriptive answer in response.\nIt's the same with ChatGPT,\nbut with all the marketing bravado\nfrom Google, I expected a more.\nStill, let's see if Gemini can actually\ntell me what the video is about.\nOh, it can.\nThe summary is pretty accurate,\njust like the example of the article\nI tried a bit earlier.\nBut seeing how Gemini pointed out\nthat I asked you guys to find three\nAI-generated segments in that video,\nand you didn't,\nI decided to ask Gemini to fix it.\nIf your expectations were high here,\nchill.\nGemini might do some things well,\nbut analyzing audio\nis just not in its specs.\nIt even admits as much.\nWhile Gemini and audio files\ndon't to mesh together,\nthe same can't be said about images.\nGoogle Gemini image generation\nis supposed to be a big thing,\nso let's give it a test drive.\nFirst things first.\nMaybe Gemini can save me the trouble\nof creating the thumbnail for this video.\nGo, go, Google.\nMake me a thumbnail, pretty please.\nWhat do you mean you can't?\nWait, no way.\nI get it.\nAll right.\nRemember how\nsomewhere around February 2024,\nGoogle rolled out\ntheir image generation tool,\nand it immediately turned out\nto be artificially diverse,\nand was practically\nracially profiling user-generated results.\nIt turns out\nGoogle still hasn't sorted that issue out,\nleaving Gemini's biased image generator\ncompletely unavailable,\nwhich is very weird,\nbecause I managed to make a sample\nas I was preparing for a recording\nand simply wanted\na bigger resolution this time.\nEven the main page of Google Gemini\nshowcases image generation\nas something it can do,\nwhich is just incorrect at the moment.\nLet's summarize.\nWhat is Google Gemini?\nGoogle Gemini Advanced\nis a paid AI chatbot akin to ChatGPT.\nIts main upsides are native integration\nof all the Google Gemini features,\nso things like docs and Google Sheets.\nThat said, the ongoing issue\nwith image generation,\nlack of filtering\non the content it can produce,\nand Google's native data collection\nmakes Gemini a little bit less desirable\nfor any privacy-worried users.\nIf you've enjoyed\nthis Google Gemini review,\nmake sure you leave a like\nand subscribe for more reviews.\nIn the meantime, head over to this video\nfor our ElevenLabs review.\nBut more importantly,\nfind out\nif you will survive the AI uprising.\nThere is three examples\nof AI speech generation in this video,\nand I bet you can't find them.\nI'll see you over there."
