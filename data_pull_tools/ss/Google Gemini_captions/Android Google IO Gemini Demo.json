  "transcript": "Hey everyone!\nCouple of months ago we launched\nGemini on Android\nand like Circle to Search, Gemini\nworks at the system level.\nSo instead of going to a separate\napp, I can bring Gemini right\nto what I'm doing.\nNow, we're making Gemini\ncontext-aware so\nit can anticipate what you're trying\nto do and provide more helpful\nsuggestions in the moment.\nIn other words, to be a more helpful\nassistant.\nSo let me show you how this works.\nAnd I have my shiny new Pixel 8a\nhere to help me\n[applause]. So my friend Pete is\nasking if I want to play pickleball\nthis weekend and I know how to\nplay tennis. Sort of.\nI have to say that for the demo.\nBut I'm new to this pickleball\nthing, so I'm going to reply and try\nto be funny and I'll say, is that\nlike tennis, but with,\npickles?\nThis will be actually a lot funnier\nwith a meme. So let me bring up\nGemini to help with that.\nAnd I'll say, create\nimage of tennis with\npickles.\nNow, one new thing you'll notice is\nthat the Gemini window now hovers in\nplace above the app, so they stay\nin the flow.\nOkay, so that generated some pretty\ngood images.\nWhat's nice is I can then drag and\ndrop any of these directly into\nthe messages app below.\nSo like, so - cool.\nLet me send that.\nAll right. So Pete was typing and he\nsays, he sent me a video\non how to play pickleball.\nAll right. Thanks, Pete. Let's tap\non that.\nThat launches YouTube.\nBut, you know, I only have 1 or 2\nburning questions about the game,\nand I can bring up Gemini to help\nwith that.\nAnd because it's context\naware, Gemini knows I'm\nlooking at a video.\nSo it proactively shows me an 'ask\nthis video' chip.\nSo let me tap on that.\nAnd now I can ask specific questions\nabout the video.\nSo for example what\nis - is - can't\ntype - the two bounce rule.\nBecause that's something that I've\nheard about but don't quite\nunderstand in the game.\nBy the way, this uses signals like\nYouTube's captions, which means you\ncan use it on billions of videos.\nSo give it a moment.\nAnd there -\nI get a nice, succinct answer.\nThe ball must bounce once on each\nside of the court after a serve.\nOkay, cool.\nLet me go back to messages.\nAnd Pete's followed up and he says,\nyou're an engineer, so here's the\nofficial rulebook for pickleball,\nokay? Thanks, Pete.\nHe's very helpful, by the way.\nOkay, so we tap on that, launch\nas a PDF, and that's an 84\npage PDF.\nI don't know how much time Pete\nthinks I have.\nAnyway, us engineers, as you all\nknow, like to work smarter, not\nharder. So instead of trawling\nthrough this entire document,\nI can pull up Gemini to help.\nAnd again, Gemini anticipates\nwhat I need and offers me and\n'ask this PDF' option.\nSo if I tap on that, Gemini\nnow ingests all of the rules to\nbecome a pickleball expert.\nAnd that means I can ask very\nesoteric questions like for\nexample, are spin\nserves\nallowed and\nlet's hit that because I've heard\nthat rule may be changing.\nNow because I'm a Gemini advanced\nuser, this works on any PDF\nand takes full advantage of the long\ncontext window.\nAnd there's just lots of times when\nthat's useful. For example, let's\nsay you're looking for a quick\nanswer in an appliance user manual.\nAnd, there you have it.\nIt turns out no spin serves are not\nallowed.\nSo Gemini not only gives\nme a clear answer to my question,\nit also shows me exactly\nwhere on the PDF to learn more.\nAwesome.\nOkay.\nSo that's a few of the ways that\nwe're enhancing Gemini to be more\ncontext aware and helpful in\nthat moment.\nAnd what you've seen here are\nthe first of really many new ways\nthat Gemini will unlock\nnew experiences at the system level.\nAnd they're only available on\nAndroid.\nYou'll see these and more coming to\nhundreds of billions of devices over\nthe next couple of months."
