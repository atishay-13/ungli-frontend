  "transcript": "Everybody's talking about Project Mariner but what&nbsp;\nexactly is it? Well Project Mariner and AI mode&nbsp;&nbsp;\nas presented at Google IO 2025 are related but not&nbsp;\nidentical. Project Mariner is an AI agent designed&nbsp;&nbsp;\nfor web interaction and task completion capable&nbsp;\nof autonomously navigating websites and performing&nbsp;&nbsp;\nmulti-step tasks like booking tickets And AI mode&nbsp;\non the other hand is a broader feature within&nbsp;&nbsp;\nGoogle's ecosystem including search and also the&nbsp;\nGemini app and Chrome And it integrates various AI&nbsp;&nbsp;\ncapabilities including those from project mariner&nbsp;\nand is designed to enhance user interactions&nbsp;&nbsp;\nwith intelligent context aware assistance.&nbsp;\nSo, essentially project Mariner's Agentic&nbsp;&nbsp;\ncapabilities are being rolled into AI mode but AI&nbsp;\nMode goes beyond Mariner serving as a platform for&nbsp;&nbsp;\nmultiple AI driven features and this could really&nbsp;\nchange the direction that AI is headed in I think&nbsp;&nbsp;\nthat it does have the potential to be the next big&nbsp;\nthing in AI development. So, welcome to Plivo Deep&nbsp;&nbsp;\nDive, I'm Caleb Friesen, your host, and today&nbsp;\nwe're going to be discussing the capabilities&nbsp;&nbsp;\nof AI mode and how it compares with Project&nbsp;\nMariner. And we'll also explore whether there&nbsp;&nbsp;\nare any other tools that can deliver the same kind&nbsp;\nof output that AI Mode does in Gemini 2.5 Pro So,&nbsp;&nbsp;\nat I/O 2025 it was shown that this mode allows&nbsp;\nusers to ask all sorts of questions. Gemini 2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;\nPro already has the ability to answer questions&nbsp;\nbut what makes this different? Well, with AI&nbsp;&nbsp;\nmode users can interact with the platform more&nbsp;\ndirectly. And you can see in this example here:&nbsp;&nbsp;\nSo, here, the user is asking to find an available&nbsp;\nhotel in Napa Valley for a stay from next Friday&nbsp;&nbsp;\nto next Sunday on Expedia And so you can see&nbsp;\nGoogle is saying I should navigate to Expedia&nbsp;&nbsp;\ndirectly as it's more efficient. It's got Expedia&nbsp;\nopen here And then it's going through its journey&nbsp;&nbsp;\nof how it's trying to find this hotel. It's&nbsp;\nmoving very quickly so it's hard to read... But,&nbsp;&nbsp;\nI could click on the 25th of the calendar select&nbsp;\nit and check the checkout date. It's clicking&nbsp;&nbsp;\ndone. The done button to confirm And then 'task&nbsp;\ncomplete' Wow, that was super super fast! You can&nbsp;&nbsp;\nselect AI mode in the regular Gemini interface&nbsp;\nand prompt it to find an available hotel in Napa&nbsp;&nbsp;\nValley for a stay from next Friday to next Sunday&nbsp;\non Expedia And it's going to search for hotels&nbsp;&nbsp;\nbased on user reviews and star ratings And you&nbsp;\ncan see how it works here It completed the task&nbsp;&nbsp;\nin within 2 minutes Actually the user can also&nbsp;\nprompt it to refine the results So for example&nbsp;&nbsp;\nif you want a specific feature like 24/7 room&nbsp;\nservice or a balcony or you have a fixed budget&nbsp;&nbsp;\nyou can include those details in your prompt&nbsp;\nand AI mode is going to search for a room that&nbsp;&nbsp;\nmatches those criteria And this could be a major&nbsp;\nbreakthrough in Agentic AI because it now enables&nbsp;&nbsp;\nusers to interact with it much like Google search&nbsp;\nexcept it does all of the searching for you. Okay,&nbsp;&nbsp;\nso now this user has compared its output to&nbsp;\nOpenAI operator to see the results You can see&nbsp;&nbsp;\nhow Operator is working on the same prompt right&nbsp;\nhere It's giving the same prompt find this hotel&nbsp;&nbsp;\nin Napa Valley And you can see right away operator&nbsp;\nopens a new browser It goes to Expedia And now&nbsp;&nbsp;\nit's seems to be searching I'm not sure It's hard&nbsp;\nto know what's going on because there's no actual&nbsp;&nbsp;\nwalk by walk through like a play-by-play the way&nbsp;\nthat it is with with Google but you can see it's&nbsp;&nbsp;\nit's selecting the dates here It's looking at&nbsp;\nthe calendar and it's sort of manually clicking&nbsp;&nbsp;\nthrough and doing all this stuff I found the dates&nbsp;\nfor the stay in Napa Valley from those dates And&nbsp;&nbsp;\nthen my guess is that it's not going to be able&nbsp;\nto go ahead and book it. It says \"Okay got it.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;\nyou clicking through there and then that's it. So,&nbsp;\nhere we can see how it's pretty much following the&nbsp;&nbsp;\nsame steps except the user did have to chime in&nbsp;\na couple of times for it to continue. And so,&nbsp;&nbsp;\nOpenAI operator took 3 minutes to complete the&nbsp;\ntask while Project Mariner finished it in just&nbsp;&nbsp;\n2 minutes And so if time is a priority here then&nbsp;\nAI mode would definitely be the go-to choice. So,&nbsp;&nbsp;\nnow let's take a look at a more complex prompt&nbsp;\nHere's what they've asked it to do find a summer&nbsp;&nbsp;\npasta recipe on Instacart and add ingredients&nbsp;\nto my cart. Okay so we see the user is putting&nbsp;&nbsp;\nin that prompt and then it's preparing the session&nbsp;\nAnd so right away we're navigating to Instacart on&nbsp;&nbsp;\nGoogle search Then it clicks on Instacart and&nbsp;\nit navigates to the search bar Clicks summer&nbsp;&nbsp;\ntime summer pasta recipe We've got a bunch of&nbsp;\nrecipes here And so I guess it's just clicking&nbsp;&nbsp;\non one and now it seems to be thinking Scroll&nbsp;\ndown to the ingredients it's Oh it's actually&nbsp;&nbsp;\ndoing Wow it's doing a Captcha. Check your email&nbsp;\nNow it's inputting the code that was sent to the&nbsp;&nbsp;\nemail So Project Mariner completed the task in&nbsp;\njust 4 minutes while OpenAI operator took about&nbsp;&nbsp;\n30 minutes to even just attempt it The user also&nbsp;\nmentioned that it spiraled out for over 30 minutes&nbsp;&nbsp;\nAnd so we can see the approach that Project&nbsp;\nMariner used here It followed a step-by-step&nbsp;&nbsp;\nprocess The user had to pitch in here and there&nbsp;\nwith login credentials when they were needed&nbsp;&nbsp;\nbut aside from that it handled everything pretty&nbsp;\nsmoothly and added the correct items to the cart&nbsp;&nbsp;\nOf course for security reasons the AI would was&nbsp;\nnot able to actually complete the purchase itself&nbsp;&nbsp;\nYou still need to do that manually But still this&nbsp;\nis a pretty major timesaver since it did all the&nbsp;&nbsp;\nwork with minimal input from the user But that's&nbsp;\nnot all that it's able to do It's actually got a&nbsp;&nbsp;\nlot more capability here As shared by Sundar&nbsp;\nPichai the CEO of Google himself these agent&nbsp;&nbsp;\ncapabilities go even further You can actually give&nbsp;\npermission to Gemini to pull details from your&nbsp;&nbsp;\nGmail and write it in a way that sounds completely&nbsp;\nlike you. This is incredibly useful because&nbsp;&nbsp;\nit reads your emails for you and then writes&nbsp;\nresponses on your behalf All you have to do is&nbsp;&nbsp;\nreview approve and then hit send So let's take a&nbsp;\nlook at a couple more examples of its capabilities&nbsp;&nbsp;\nHere we have another operator prompt to schedule&nbsp;\na locksmith to rekey my locks this weekend So it&nbsp;&nbsp;\nseems like this is kind of a tough one, right so&nbsp;\nlet's see how Project Manor handles this okay so&nbsp;&nbsp;\nit's actually referring to the market prices for&nbsp;\nthe service and it's giving a rough estimate Now&nbsp;&nbsp;\nit's finding people who could potentially help&nbsp;\nwith the rekeying We've got three people here&nbsp;&nbsp;\nIt's scheduling the appointment and checking&nbsp;\nuser reviews to see if the person is really the&nbsp;&nbsp;\nbest fit And then it first switched from Google&nbsp;\nto Thumbtack to add the pin-code to find nearby&nbsp;&nbsp;\noptions And then in the end the user only had&nbsp;\nto provide their details for the appointment&nbsp;&nbsp;\nto be scheduled And it's especially interesting&nbsp;\nbecause if AI can support and automate multiple&nbsp;&nbsp;\ntasks like this it has the potential to completely&nbsp;\ntransform how we manage our time and productivity&nbsp;&nbsp;\nSo far we've seen that it can plan trips order&nbsp;\nitems and make reservations for you And it's&nbsp;&nbsp;\nalso a good thing that they've incorporated&nbsp;\nuser acknowledgement and oversight While AI&nbsp;&nbsp;\nhas come a long way it still can't think or&nbsp;\nunderstand the way that a human can. And so&nbsp;&nbsp;\nit can do things for you but it can't replace&nbsp;\nyou Oversight is important not only to build&nbsp;&nbsp;\nuser trust but also to ensure that AI doesn't&nbsp;\nmake the wrong decision And so we've seen its&nbsp;&nbsp;\ncapabilities but what does the pricing for this&nbsp;\nactually look like? Now this is available to US&nbsp;&nbsp;\nsubscribers of Google's new AI Ultra plan priced&nbsp;\nat $249 per month. They get hands-on access to&nbsp;&nbsp;\nProject Mariner first. Google is also bringing&nbsp;\nthe capabilities of Project Mariner to the Gemini&nbsp;&nbsp;\nAPI and also Vertex AI And we've already seen&nbsp;\nexamples of AI mode in Gemini 2.5 before but&nbsp;&nbsp;\nhave you tried it out yet?
